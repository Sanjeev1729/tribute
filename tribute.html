         <ul>
             <li>
                 Dennis Ritchie was born on September 9,1941 in New York.
             </li>
             <li>
                His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime Bell Labs scientist. 
             </li>
             <li>
                Ritchie is best known as the creator of the C programming language, a key developer of the Unix operating system, and co-author of the book The C Programming Language; he was the 'R' in KAndR (a common reference to the book's authors Kernighan and Ritchie).
             </li>
             <li>
                In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system.
             </li>
             <li>
                Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name at all, but... if you had a microscope and could look in a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside.
